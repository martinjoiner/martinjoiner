    <section class="project">
		<header>
        	<h3>CarePlanner</h3>
			<span class="dRange">Sep 2022 - Present</span>
		</header>
        <p>Joined as part of the API Team, built a complex new endpoint that projected composite data over a calendar
			view.</p>

		<p>Promoted to lead a new <strong>Integrations Team</strong> inheriting 5 complicated projects
			written in {% tag "PHP" %} {% tag "Symfony" %} with {% tag "AWS" %} SNS/SQS powered event driven
			architecture. They all needed words and diagrams to document how they worked with partner
			company's {% tag tech="APIs", tag="restapi" %}.</p>

		<p>Devised a new internal platform for support staff to manage partner integrations. This included unprocessable
			entity reporting and {% tag "JavaScript" %} {% tag tech="WebSocket" %} powered animated progress bars
			that visualise the huge sync jobs which can take up to 40 minutes.</p>

		<p>During acquisition by
			<a href="https://nourishcare.com/" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">Nourish Care</a> I led the
			new build of the CarePlanner-Nourish integration project.</p>

		<p>All projects use {% tag tech="CircleCI", tag="ci" %} running {% tag tech="Behat" %} {% tag "PHPUnit" %} {% tag "Psalm" %}
			{% tag "CodeSniffer" %} and {% tag "Docker" %} for local dev.

        	<h3>Worktribe</h3> <span class="dRange">2020 - Feb 2022</span>
		</header>

		<p>University administration software. Helped maintain their mature legacy procedural {% tag "PHP" %} codebase.</p>

		<p>Led the build of a new backend. An {% tag tech="API", tag="restapi" %} built in {% tag "Laravel" %}
			on {% tag tech="PHP 8", tag="php" %}
            that published live chat to a {% tag "JavaScript" %} {% tag tech="WebSocket" %} server and
			used {% tag "Firebase" %} Cloud Messaging for notifications.
            Automated tests in {% tag "Behat" %} run by {% tag tech="ChipperCI", tag="ci" %}.
			Wrote command-line scripts to produce a simulation of live chat for load-testing whole system.
            Contributed to {% tag "React Native" %} app.
            Administered deployments to {% tag "AWS" %}.
            Dabbled in {% tag "Docker" %}.

        	<h3>RCoA Lifelong Learning Platform</h3>
			<span class="dRange">2017 - 2019</span>
		</header>

        <p class="role">Via my role as Principal Developer at <a href="https://www.nomensa.com/">Nomensa</a></p>

		<p>A bespoke application for <a href="https://www.rcoa.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Royal College of Anaesthetists</a>
			to track learners progress toward qualifying.
            Many complex multi-user workflows with strict role-based permissions. I led a team of 3 devs (me + 2),
            full time for over 2 years to deliver and then iteratively improve this complex application.
            Recruited to rescue the project, I inherited the codebase in a bad state and applied proper Laravel-style
            techniques to leverage the full power of the framework. Built in
			{% tag "Laravel" %}
            and {% tag "JavaScript" %}, test-coverage
            with {% tag tech="Behat" %} and pipeline/deployment managed
            through {% tag tech="GitLab CI", tag="ci" %}. Notable features included partial functionality offline
            via Service Worker API.

			<h3>Open Mic Finder</h3>
			<span class="dRange">2010 - Present day</span>
		</header>

		<p>I built Open Mic Finder in 2010 driven by a frustration at the lack of <em>reliable</em> online information.
			Over a decade later and it's still running with ~16,000 unique users per month, with a database holding
			~4000 sets of venue details, all submitted and maintained by the users themselves.

			It generates no revenue but I keep it alive as a demonstration of my ability to design, build and
			administrate an entire website on a long term basis.
		</p>
		<p>
			Over the 14 years I've taken it from {% tag "PHP" %} version 5.4 to 8.3, survived the browser wars,
			replaced the interactive Flash map with Google Maps API, made the interface responsive,
			played with Open Graph Protocol and Rich snippets,
			Leveraged several free {% tag tech="APIs", tag="restapi" %} (Twitter, MeetUp, MailChimp, Transport),
			tried and failed to attract sponsorship,
			moved from {% tag "Vagrant" %} to {% tag "Docker" %} for local dev, added tests in {% tag "PHPUnit" %}.

			attempt in Cornwall in 2017. Using a {% tag tech="WebSocket" %} connection to a backend that was receiving

			<span class="dRange">Summer 2017</span>
		</header>

		<p class="role">Via contract at <a href="https://createhealth.com/">Create Health</a></p>

        <p>An employee benefits provider tasked me with building a news and social platform capable of being customised
			for multiple companies and integrating with their current legacy HR systems. New-build in

        	<h3>Carbon Reduction Scenario Simulator</h3>
			<span class="dRange"> Spring 2017</span>
		</header>

        <p>After my previous rescue effort for Real World Visuals they asked me to pick up an unfinished, partly broken {% tag tech="CodeIgniter" %} project, pull the back-end code up to standard and get it stable and live-ready. Deployed with {% tag "Capistrano" %}.</p>

    <section class="project">

			<h3>Estate Carbon Emissions Visualiser</h3>
			<span class="dRange">2017</span>
		</header>

        <p>Real World Visuals needed some help making a fledgling product fit for demonstration. Picking up where
			another dev left off I merged 2 tightly-coupled repos that should never have been separate and worked across
			the full stack to polish and standardise the codebase so that I could then implement critical features ready
			for client demo. {% tag "PHP" %}
			({% tag tech="CodeIgniter" %} framework), SQLite database,
			{% tag "REST API" %} and {% tag "WebGL" %},
			{% tag "JavaScript" %}, CSS interface. Deployed with {% tag "Capistrano" %}.

			<h3>BookFetch</h3>
			<span class="dRange">2017</span>
		</header>

		<p>A failed charitable startup. Built an OAuth protected {% tag "REST API" %}
			({% tag tech="Laravel 5", tag="laravel" %} running on {% tag tech="PHP 7", tag="php" %}) that allowed
			any cheap {% tag "Raspberry Pi" %} with a USB barcode scanner attached and running a {% tag "Python" %}
			script to rapidly log a shop's stock. The backend would then identify the books using the
			<a href="https://isbndb.com/">ISBNdb</a> {% tag tech="API", tag="restapi" %},
			scrape online retail prices and identify which books are worth listing for sale online.

			<h3>Food Franchiser's Internal System</h3>
			<span class="dRange">2016</span>
		</header>

        <p>An outdated and messy legacy {% tag "PHP" %} (Concrete 5) codebase had begun to run frustratingly slow.
        	I performed code surgery and properly normalised the 58+ million row {% tag "MySQL" %} database,
			managing to successfully reduce report generation time from minutes to seconds.
        	I also improved the frontend interface, adding tips and strict validation to ensure the users were
			inputting data in a standardised format.
